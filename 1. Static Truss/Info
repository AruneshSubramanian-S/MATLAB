Static Truss
    + The script file can take '.mat' file as input. 
    + 'truss_1, truss_2, truss_3, truss_4' are the example inputs in this case - each with different conditions and load bearing properties.
    + Input file contains different parameters - Coordinate matrix, Connectivity matrix, Bearings matrix and Froce matrix.
    + Script loads these inputs, plot the connection plot and calculate degree of freedom of the given sytem.
    + Based on the inputs, it can determine the load bearing capacity of the system and compute coefficient matrix.
    + Compute the tension on each bars and sketch the connection based on the tension.
